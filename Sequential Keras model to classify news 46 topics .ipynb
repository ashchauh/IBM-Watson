Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will then save your model in HDF5 format.\n\n##\u00a0Data\n\nFor this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n\n## Goal\n\nWe want to create a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras which we can train to classify news items into the specified 46 topics.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe start by importing everything we need for this exercise:",

For this we use a *Tokenizer* from Keras' text preprocessing module. This tokenizer will take an index sequence and map it to a vector of length *max_words=1000*. Each of the 1000 vector positions corresponds to one of the words in our newswire corpus. The output of the tokenizer has a 1 at the i-th position of the vector, if the word corresponding to i is in the description of the newswire, and 0 otherwise. Even if this word appears multiple times, we still just put a 1 into our vector, i.e. our tokenizer is binary. We use this tokenizer to transform both train and test features:",
